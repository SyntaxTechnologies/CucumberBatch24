support libraries -
java
selenium
cucumber
apache
commons

we have added all the dependencies in the pom.xml and reload the maven

test - where we write the code to test the application

under test - java and resources for technical and non technical respectively

now we need to check, what packages and directories we need to work with cucumber

--first we need feature file to write scenarios in BDD/gherkin - the extension of this file is .feature

steps package - for all steps classes
rules for step definition - we cannot have duplicate steps definition
we cannot change the step def after creating it

utils - for all the classes that will be used for the whole project

background - all the steps which are common in one feature file for all scenarios till flow is same.
for every feature file, background will be different


class 2 -

examples table - first hooks execute then background then scenario execute multiple times
data table - first hook execute one time then background execute one time but step execute multiple times

when your one test case executes against multiple sets of data
to achieve data driven testing we have -
examples table - hooks, background and scenario execute multiple times
data table - for efficient execution
excel file - for larger sets of data

Class 3 -

characteristics of framework -
framework should be scalable -
framework should be mature enough
no hard coded data should be passed
data driven testing should be available
with minimum efforts, code should be fixed (Low maintanence time)

page object model design patter -
for every single screen/page of the application, we create a page class in the framework and keep all the locators
of this page in the class

validation proof -
Assertions - assertions are used to validate in 2 different ways

existence of element check = login button is available or not
value of the element exist

reports -
multiple runner -
failed runner -
screenshots -
plugins -

homework - validate the employee that has added is the same which you added

plugins part -Rest Assured library
 rest web services - this web service allows data to be sent in JSON format

 Rest assured is DSL (Domain Specific Language) which is used to test REST web services
    it is open source library which is used to validate and verify the REST web services
    it is used to validate the response of the API
    rest assured follows BDD approach
    it supports multiple languages like java, python, ruby etc
    it supports multiple frameworks like testng, junit etc
    BDD syntax - given, when, then, and, but
    we can use rest assured with cucumber framework also

    here is rest assured -
    given - pre-condition - like headers, authentication, cookies, params etc (prepare the request)
    when - action - like get, post, put, delete (to send the request/hit the endpoint)
    then - validation - like status code, response time, body etc. (validate the response using assertions)

First - we will see how API works alone and then we will integrate it with cucumber framework.
