support libraries -
java
selenium
cucumber
apache
commons

we have added all the dependencies in the pom.xml and reload the maven

test - where we write the code to test the application

under test - java and resources for technical and non technical respectively

now we need to check, what packages and directories we need to work with cucumber

--first we need feature file to write scenarios in BDD/gherkin - the extension of this file is .feature

steps package - for all steps classes
rules for step definition - we cannot have duplicate steps definition
we cannot change the step def after creating it

utils - for all the classes that will be used for the whole project

background - all the steps which are common in one feature file for all scenarios till flow is same.
for every feature file, background will be different


class 2 -

examples table - first hooks execute then background then scenario execute multiple times
data table - first hook execute one time then background execute one time but step execute multiple times

when your one test case executes against multiple sets of data
to achieve data driven testing we have -
examples table - hooks, background and scenario execute multiple times
data table - for efficient execution
excel file - for larger sets of data

Class 3 -

characteristics of framework -
framework should be scalable -
framework should be mature enough
no hard coded data should be passed
data driven testing should be available
with minimum efforts, code should be fixed (Low maintanence time)

page object model design patter -
for every single screen/page of the application, we create a page class in the framework and keep all the locators
of this page in the class

validation proof -
Assertions - assertions are used to validate in 2 different ways

existence of element check = login button is available or not
value of the element exist
