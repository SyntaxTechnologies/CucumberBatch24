support libraries -
java
selenium
cucumber
apache
commons

we have added all the dependencies in the pom.xml and reload the maven

test - where we write the code to test the application

under test - java and resources for technical and non technical respectively

now we need to check, what packages and directories we need to work with cucumber

--first we need feature file to write scenarios in BDD/gherkin - the extension of this file is .feature

steps package - for all steps classes
rules for step definition - we cannot have duplicate steps definition
we cannot change the step def after creating it

utils - for all the classes that will be used for the whole project

background - all the steps which are common in one feature file for all scenarios till flow is same.
for every feature file, background will be different



class 2 -

examples table - first hooks execute then background then scenario execute multiple times
data table - first hook execute one time then background execute one time but step execute multiple times

when your one test case executes against multiple sets of data
to achieve data driven testing we have -
examples table - hooks, background and scenario execute multiple times
data table - for efficient execution
excel file - for larger sets of data
